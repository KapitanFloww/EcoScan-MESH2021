# Öko-Scan        
### Challenge: Environmental 

#### Digitalization and the technologies that come along with it, such as 5G, give us the chance to correct the mistakes made by the industrialization. But if we do not change the behavior of consumers, these technologies alone will not be able to stop climate change!


That's why we developed a proof of concept called: Eco-Scan. With this app, products can be scanned and users can get information about the products and whether there might be better alternatives. If we change the behavior of the customers, the producers will be forced to adapt to their needs and take the problem into their own hands! 

#### And if politics fails to provide customers with a clear overview of the product and only relies on voluntary labeling (FAIRTRADE, NUTRI-SCORE etc.), then customers will have to do it themselves and for this they can use "Öko-Scan".
