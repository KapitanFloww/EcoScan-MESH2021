### Challenge: Environmental 

#### Digitalization and the new technologies that come along with it, such as 5G, give us the chance to correct the mistakes made by the industrialization. But if we do not change the behavior of consumers, the technologies alone will not stop the climate change!

That's why we developed a proof of concept for the Eco-Scan app. With it, products can be scanned and users get information about their sustainability and whether there might be better alternatives. If we change the behavior of the customers, the producers will be forced to adapt to their needs and take the problem into their own hands.
